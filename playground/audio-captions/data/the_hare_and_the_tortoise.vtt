00:25.000 --> 00:37.000
The Hare was once boasting of his speed before the other animals. "I have never yet been beaten," said he, "when I put forth my full speed. I challenge any one here to race with me."

00:37.000 --> 00:41.000
The Tortoise said quietly, "I accept your challenge."

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
"That is a good joke," said the Hare; "I could dance round you all the way."

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
"Keep your boasting till you've beaten," answered the Tortoise. "Shall we race?"

00:53.000 --> 01:20.000
So a course was fixed and a start was made. The Hare darted almost out of sight at once, but soon stopped and, to show his contempt for the Tortoise, lay down to have a nap. The Tortoise plodded on and plodded on, and when the Hare awoke from his nap, he saw the Tortoise just near the winning-post and could not run up in time to save the race. Then said the Tortoise:

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
"Plodding wins the race."
